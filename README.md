Hello dear reader,
      I am Suhas N Kumar, a student of Srinivas University Bangalore studying 5th semester of BCA, this repository is a collection of my projects submitted to Tamizan Skills' RISE Internship program, I am really grateful for providing me this opportunity.
      On the course of pursuing this internship I explored various unknown domains of Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking, they provided me very practical and existing problem statements with insightful mentorship and never let me down, this initiative of theirs is really helpfulf for under privileged students like me and many others. 
      I look forward to work and be helpful in any way to the organisation and be a part of such a selfless initative.

This repository has multiple branches, each representing a project with the source code and a README file bearing the step-by-step instructions to execute it.
It is a humble request that if you want to immplement this code anywhere, try not to compy it completely and borrow some part of the logic, as it will be of no use if you copy somebody else's hardwork.

Thanks and regards,
Suhas N Kumar,
